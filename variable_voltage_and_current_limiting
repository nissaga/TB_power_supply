I have reviewed some alternatives to have a variable voltage. The most used is LM317. However I still have the problem with current limiting.

Therefore I have decided to go for a buck-boost converter which includes the variable voltage and the current limiting. Also includes voltage and current reading. It cost near 20â‚¬, but I think it's worth it.

In this way, I will not get stuck in the project.
