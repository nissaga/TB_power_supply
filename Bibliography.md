#Bibliography
Here I will put some of the similar projects I have found to take some ideas.

For sure there are a lot more, but I will focuse on the ones above.

First, I will classify the different projects.
## Fixed voltage
The ones present here, do not have a variable voltage output
https://github.com/onemarcfifty/arduino-bargraph-powersupply -> This one includes an arduino to do a Bar graph of the current consumption. Very interesting, but not for the present project.
https://hackaday.io/project/184598-maker-your-own-professional-bench-power-supply -> This one uses only one volt/ampmeter, and connecting the line to it, will show you the voltage and the amperes. Good to know!
## Variable voltage
###Using buck boost converters
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4711395
https://www.theneverendingprojectslist.com/miscprojects/atx-bench-power-supply/
https://github.com/joao-pinheiro/atx_psu -> This one has two variable outputs, one from 1,2 to 12V and another from 12 to 60V
